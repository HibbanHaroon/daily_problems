# Daily Problems - 100 Hrs ðŸš€

Welcome to my daily problem-solving journey as I embark on a quest to complete 100 Hrs of coding problems daily! ðŸŽ‰ Every day, I dedicate time to solving coding problems, and I'll be sharing my progress and learning here. 


| Hour | Problems Solved                                | What Did I Learn                                    |

|      | 8. [mini-max-sum.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/2hr/8.%20mini-max-sum.py)  |                                                         |

| 7hr  | 23. [counting_valleys.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/7hr/23.%20counting_valleys.py)  | Interesting Problem. Had fun solving it. |
|      | 24. [electronics_shop.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/7hr/24.%20electronics_shop.py)  |                                                         |

| 8hr  | 26. [forming_a_magic_square.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/8hr/26.%20forming_a_magic_square.py)  | This is not a complete solution. The complete solution is in the next day. I was successful in making every number in the square identical by replacing the duplicates with the missing numbers. But in order to make the square a magic square, every column, row, and diagonal needs to add up to the magic number and then calculate the minimal cost. I looked at the forum. Out of all the problems, I find the solution to this problem to be the biggest cop out. I mean seriously??? Having predefined set of magic squares and then calculating the minimal cost from that. I expected a better solution. |
