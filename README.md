# Daily Problems - 100 Hrs ðŸš€

Welcome to my daily problem-solving journey as I embark on a quest to complete 100 Hrs of coding problems daily! ðŸŽ‰ Every day, I dedicate 1 hour to solving coding problems, and I'll be sharing my progress and learning here.

|      | 6. [plus-minus.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/1hr/6.%20plus-minus.py)  |  I learned how to use functions like `zip`, calculate absolute values with `abs`, and format strings effectively when printing.  |
| 2hr  | 7. [staircase.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/2hr/7.%20staircase.py)  |                                                         |

|      | 9. [birthday-cake-candles.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/2hr/9.%20birthday-cake-candles.py)  |                                                         |
|      | 10. [time-conversion.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/2hr/10.%20time-conversion.py)  | It was a pretty good interesting problem. I liked the `zfill` function I used to append leading zeroes in front of a string. |
| 3hr  | 11. [grading_students.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/3hr/11.%20grading_students.py)  |                                                         |

| 4hr  | 14. [between_two_sets.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/4hr/14.%20between_two_sets.py)  | Pretty interesting and a bit complex problem but it was fun solving it. |

|      | 18. [migratory_birds.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/5hr/18.%20migratory_birds.py)  |                                                         |
| 6hr  | 19. [day_of_the_programmer.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/6hr/19.%20day_of_the_programmer.py)  |                                                         |

|      | 21. [sales_by_match.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/6hr/21.%20sales_by_match.py)  | I used the `//` operator for the first time. Pretty nice. |

| 7hr  | 23. [counting_valleys.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/7hr/23.%20counting_valleys.py)  | Interesting Problem. Had fun solving it. |
|      | 24. [electronics_shop.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/7hr/24.%20electronics_shop.py)  |                                                         |
|      | 25. [cats_and_a_mouse.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/7hr/25.%20cats_and_a_mouse.py)  |                                                         |
| 8hr  | 26. [forming_a_magic_square.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/8hr/26.%20forming_a_magic_square.py)  | This is not a complete solution. The complete solution is in the next day. I was successful in making every number in the square identical by replacing the duplicates with the missing numbers. But in order to make the square a magic square, every column, row, and diagonal needs to add up to the magic number and then calculate the minimal cost. I looked at the forum. Out of all the problems, I find the solution to this problem to be the biggest cop out. I mean seriously??? Having predefined set of magic squares and then calculating the minimal cost from that. I expected a better solution. |
| 9hr  | 26. [forming_a_magic_square.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/9hr/26.%20forming_a_magic_square.py)  | Continued the problem from the previous day. |
| 10hr | 27. [picking_numbers.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/10hr/27.%20picking_numbers.py)  | It will give the correct result. The logic is correct. However, the time complexity is through the roof (2 ^ n). Gonna look at the forum for the correct approach tomorrow. |
| 11hr | 27. [picking_numbers.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/11hr/27.%20picking_numbers.py)  | I'm honestly speechless how good of a solution this is compared to my previous solution where I solved the problem through recursion. Thanks to the forum for inspiration. |
| 12hr | 28. [climbing_the_leaderboard.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/12hr/28.%20climbing_the_leaderboard.py)  | The code for now is returning the final ranked list. But, I haven't added the logic of finding the rankings from this list. Gonna continue the problem tomorrow. |
| 13hr | 28. [climbing_the_leaderboard.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/13hr/28.%20climbing_the_leaderboard.py)  | This code isn't passing all the test cases due to time being exceeded. |
| 14hr | 28. [climbing_the_leaderboard.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/14hr/28.%20climbing_the_leaderboard.py)  | Since my code wasn't passing some test cases due to time complexity, I took inspiration from a solution I found on Hackerrank forum. The problem is I'm not reading the given statement properly and not thinking outside the box. |
| 15hr | 29. [the_hurdle_race.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/15hr/29.%20the_hurdle_race.py)  |                                                         |
|      | 30. [designer_pdf_viewer.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/15hr/30.%20designer_pdf_viewer.py)  | I used the `ord` function to convert the character to its ASCII value, which was pretty nice. |
|      | 31. [utopian_tree.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/15hr/31.%20utopian_tree.py)  | Understood that the `range` function's ending point is exclusive. |
|      | 32. [angry_professor.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/15hr/32.%20angry_professor.py)  | Honestly, it was a good and tricky problem. Understanding the problem was important. |
|      | 33. [beautiful-days_at_the_movies.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/15hr/33.%20beautiful-days_at_the_movies.py)  | The `join` function was very useful. But, I looked at the forum and found that the number can be reversed very efficiently using slicing, such as `int(str(num)[::-1])` where the first colon means to include all the elements and `-1` means to traverse the string in reverse order. |
